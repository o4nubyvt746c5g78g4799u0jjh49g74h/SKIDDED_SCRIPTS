# SKIDDED_SCRIPTS

In the past, I used to work with skidded scripts, and at one point, I even accidentally leaked my own work. However, I want to clarify that I no longer engage in skidding and have since moved on to creating original, clean scripts. Iâ€™ve focused on improving my skills and ensuring that everything I produce is my own work. If there are any concerns or questions regarding this, feel free to create a ticket, and I will gladly debunk or clarify anything needed. My goal is to maintain transparency and professionalism moving forward. These scripts does not support any most dahood ripoffs these scripts or most likey outdated on every game.
